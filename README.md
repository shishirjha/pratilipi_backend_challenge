# Pratilipi Backend Hiring challenge

Technologies that I have used:

1. Postgres for database(so that I can use features like ArrayField etc.)
2. django and djangorestframework for rest api

To run the project:

1. download and unzip the folder
2. create a table named 'pratilipi2' in your postgres database. Edit username and password in database settings.
3. create a virtual environment
4. install all the dependencies from requirements.txt file
5. run the project using usual manage.py command
